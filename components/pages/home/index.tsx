          Coming from a strong DevOps background I understand the importance of
          cultural DevOps adoption. I have a proven history of helping companies
          drive DevOps culture, engaging with various technical and
          non-technical stakeholders across a range of different team
          topologies.
        </Paragraph>
        <Paragraph>
          I have seen firsthand the benefits companies gain from this adoption.
          Whether it be the ability to pivot and experiment with best in class
          tooling or be the first to market delivering value with velocity and
          confidence.
