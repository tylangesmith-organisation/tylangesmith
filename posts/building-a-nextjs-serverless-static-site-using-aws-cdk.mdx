In this blog, we'll explore how to host a Next.js static site on AWS. We'll design a fully serverless solution using AWS CloudFront, CloudFront Functions, and S3. We'll then take this serverless solution and leverage AWS CDK to define our infrastructure as code.

For this blog, we'll attempt to host a simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) static site I've implemented [nextjs-serverless-static-site.tylangesmith.com](https://nextjs-serverless-static-site.tylangesmith.com).

Of course, if you want to jump straight to the code, you can by checking out the project [GitHub repository](https://github.com/tylangesmith-organisation/nextjs-serverless-static-site)!

## Designing our Solution

Awesome! So we want to develop a hosting solution for our Next.js static site. Naturally, we want a solution that'll be performant,  scalable, reliable, secure, and cost-optimised. We also want to try and keep things relatively simple.

Thankfully, since our website is static, we can meet all of these requirements without too much hassle.

Before we dive straight in, it's also worth mentioning that these days there are some really excellent hosting alternatives like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). These hosting solutions make deploying a Next.js project ridiculously easy, not to mention it provides a bunch of optimisations right out of the box. From a developer experience perspective, this is amazing and well worth consideration.

However, to gain a deeper understanding, we will take a more hands-on approach. We'll implement our solution using [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/). AWS is a cloud platform that provides hundreds of cloud services to solve a variety of problems.

> If you're a beginner in this space, it can be pretty overwhelming at first. However, from experience, if you stick with it, you'll quickly be able to navigate the ecosystem with confidence.

So with all of that in mind, we can implement a solution that looks like the following.

Hopefully, that doesn't look too scary - let's break each of these components down to better understand how they all fit together.

### AWS Simple Storage Service (S3)

When we build our Next.js project, we get a bunch of static files, also known as a static bundle; we need somewhere to store these files. For that, we can use [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) (Simple Storage Service). As the name suggests, it provides a simple service that enables us to store objects.

These objects are stored in what's known as a bucket. Once stored and configured with the correct permissions, objects within this bucket can be accessed via a few different methods, e.g. an object URL.

> One of the most prominent data leakage vectors companies face is through misconfigured s3 buckets

If we uploaded our static bundle to a bucket we've created named `mybucket` and wanted to grab the `index.html` file, we could do so via the object URL `https://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket/index.html`.

This gives us somewhere to store our objects, but just storing these objects and accessing them via the S3 REST APIs isn't quite enough to host a website.

Thankfully AWS S3 has built-in [Static Website Hosting](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteHosting.html) functionality that will serve our static bundle. This has a few key [differences](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/WebsiteEndpoints.html#WebsiteRestEndpointDiff) from that of the S3 REST APIs.

<ProseWidth>

After configuring our index and custom error documents, we can access our static site through an S3 website endpoint. To access the index of our website, we can do so with `http://mybucket.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com`.

This is a pretty decent initial solution, but we want to go a few steps further. Notably, the website is accessed via `HTTP`; we don't have a personalised URL, and our content is being served out of `us-east-1`, which isn't great for users across the other side of the world.

### AWS CloudFront

[AWS CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) is a content delivery network ([CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network)) that enables us to securely deliver our content to our users with low latency. CloudFront solves a few issues for us. One of the main selling points is that we can cache our content geographically close to our users via hundreds of edge locations.

  label="CloudFront Content Propogation"

<ProseWidth>

As we can see, the content served from our S3 website endpoint is propagated across our CloudFront distribution and cached across many edge nodes. This reduces the distance the users' request for content has to travel, ultimately increasing delivery speed. The user now accesses our static content via the CloudFront distribution URL `xyz.cloudfront.net`.

Next, we can put this CloudFront distribution URL behind a custom URL, `nextjs-serverless-static-site.tylangesmith.com`, with a simple [AWS Route53](https://aws.amazon.com/route53/) record. After that, we can generate an SSL certificate for the domain with [AWS ACM](https://aws.amazon.com/certificate-manager/) (Certificate Manager) and attach it to our CloudFront distribution enforcing `HTTPS`.

### CloudFront Functions

OK, one last thing we need to account for. When the user accesses our website via the URL `https://nextjs-serverless-static-site.tylangesmith.com`, the S3 website endpoint knows that we need to return our index document; once returned, the Next.js library is loaded. The user can click around and navigate to different pages from this initially loaded index document, e.g. `https://nextjs-serverless-static-site.tylangesmith.com/blog/some-blog`.

Since the Next.js library is loaded, the inbuilt router knows that when the users' browser navigates to the `blog/some-blog` path, we really want to send a request for the `blog/some-blog.html` HTML file.

</ProseWidth>

<Image
  source="buildingAServerlessBlogUsingNextjsAndAwsCdk/nextjsRouterLoaded.png"
  alt="Requests with Next.js Loaded"
  label="Requests with Next.js Loaded"

<ProseWidth>

However, a problem arises when the user requests the `https://nextjs-serverless-static-site.tylangesmith.com/blog/some-blog` URL without the Next.js library first being loaded. E.g. when refreshing the page.

The `/blog/some-blog` path isn't translated into `blog/some-blog.html`. Which results in the `/blog/some-blog` path being requested instead.

</ProseWidth>

  source="buildingAServerlessBlogUsingNextjsAndAwsCdk/nextjsRouterNotLoaded.png"
  alt="Requests without Next.js Loaded"
  label="Requests without Next.js Loaded"
/>

<ProseWidth>

As a result, the S3 website endpoint cannot find the related file and instead returns the configured error document.

We need to ensure these paths are translated for the required requests to address this. We can achieve this by configuring a CloudFront behaviour to run a lightweight [CloudFront Function](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-cloudfront-functions-run-your-code-at-the-edge-with-low-latency-at-any-scale/).

<Image
  source="buildingAServerlessBlogUsingNextjsAndAwsCdk/cloudfrontFunction.png"
  alt="CloudFront with CloudFront Function"
  label="CloudFront with CloudFront Function"
/>

<ProseWidth>

We can trigger this CloudFront Function on the required paths, mapping the incoming request to the correct related file within our S3 bucket.

🎉 that should be everything! Our solution should now satisfy all of our original requirements.

## Infrastructure as Code

We're now at the point where we can start defining our above infrastructure as code using AWS CDK. Again our high-level solution architecture looks like the following:

<ProseWidth>

Let's break down each of these components and define them as CDK.

### Overview of AWS CDK

Before AWS CDK, there were a few other ways to define our infrastructure as code. One of the main ways being with a [CloudFormation Template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/gettingstarted.templatebasics.html#gettingstarted.templatebasics.what) which allowed for infrastructure to be defined in a `yaml` or `json` file. 

This was an excellent win for DevOps as infrastructure could be easily defined as code. However, complex infrastructure projects often required verbose CloudFormation Template definitions, quickly becoming hard to maintain and error-prone.
