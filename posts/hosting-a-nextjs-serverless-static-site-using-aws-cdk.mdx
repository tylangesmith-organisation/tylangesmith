title: Hosting a Next.js serverless static site using AWS CDK
description: In this blog, we'll explore how to host a Next.js static site on AWS. We'll use AWS CloudFront, Lambda@Edge, and S3 to implement a fully serverless solution. Being the awesome DevOps practitioners we are, we'll also leverage AWS CDK to define our infrastructure as code.

## Introduction

For a while, I've wanted to start a personal blog. As a professional, this is one of the best ways to get your expertise and name out into the world. So I thought why not give it a go!

For now, I've chosen to implement this blog using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a popular web development framework built on top of React. It provides many features right out of the box, has an exceptional developer experience, and has a large development community.

Currently, I work with [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) daily. So naturally, it makes sense to design and implement a solution to host my blog using this cloud ecosystem.

It's also worth noting that there are a fair few other hosting options available e.g. [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). However, these options tend to abstract away a lot of the underlying infrastructure and ultimately provide developers with less understanding of how their applications are deployed. This has its target audience but for us, a one-click hosting solution doesn't sound like much fun.

All of the code for this blog can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/tylangesmith-organisation/tylangesmith).
